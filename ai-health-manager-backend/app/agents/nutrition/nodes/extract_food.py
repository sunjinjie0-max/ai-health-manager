   - unit: Use exactly one of these values: "g", "kg", "ml", "l", "cup", "bowl", "piece", "slice", or "serving"
   - category: Food category (protein, vegetable, fruit, grain, dairy, fat, beverage, condiment, other)
   - confidence: Your confidence in this extraction (0.0-1.0)

Be thorough and extract ALL food items mentioned. If quantities are not specified, use typical serving sizes as estimates.
Normalize every food name to its common Simplified Chinese name while preserving important preparation details, such as "炸鸡" instead of the broader term "鸡肉".
